        <p>One of the highlights of my 2014 was speaking at
<a href="https://www.defcon.org/">DEF CON 22</a> in early August. I got to present my ideas on
a big stage, meet some interesting folks in the security community, and
lose a small amount of money at Las Vegas casinos.</p>

<p>It was my first DEF CON, so I was a bit overwhelmed. My coworkers and the
Speaker Goons took good care of me, and I managed to survive the weekend.</p>

<p>The main idea of the presentation is that, to an attacker, web cookies can
be more valuable than passwords. Sites generally send authentication cookies to your browser after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a> takes place. If someone
can steal cookies off of your computer, they will be able log in as you without
redoing two-factor authentication; a stolen password does not have this power.</p>

<p>In the talk, I went into detail about various ways that cookies can be stolen
from popular web browsers. I focused on client-side attacks (malware and
reading unencrypted hard drives), because sniffing cookies that are sent over
plain HTTP connections has been done numerous times before.</p>

<p>DEF CON was definitely a lot of fun. If you're
interested in computer security, it's a great event. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVwaIe6CiHw">DEF CON
documentary</a> is worth watching, too. Thanks to everyone who helped
put on the con, and for giving me the opportunity to speak!</p>

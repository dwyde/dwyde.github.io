YELLOW ladies and MAGENTA-lmen;
Welcome BLACK to the GRAYest show on EARTH TONES.
RUST AZUREd we PEACHure no LILAC of ORANGE-inal acts.

Feats of brains, BRONZE, and AQUA-batics will TEAL the spotLIGHT.
Mass WISTERIA may STRIPE as men are SAPPHIREd from cannons,
and bullets APRICOT with bare hands.
But I PINK that PALEs in CONTRAST to my own a-MAIZE-ing story.

Years ago my WHEAT-heart left me for a pantoLIME-r.
I begged on my EBONYs and swore AMETHYSTtime would be different.
But it was too SLATE, and she said "CYAN-ara".

My heart was in smither-GREENS, my mind a TAN-GOLD mess.
I BLUE it, AUBURNed my bridges.
I was MAROONed with no next-of-PUMPKIN, no pets ORCHIDs.
I CHROMEd the CARNATION from Ne-BRASS-ka to PittsBURGUNDY,
searching far and WHITE for content-MINT.

PINE-ally I was REDy to PURPLE myself up.
I said, "OLIVE through this".
I MUSTARD my cour-ROUGE and joined the circus.

There VERMILIONs of COBALTernatives,
from PLUM-ing to nuclear FUCHSIA-n,
but I had to SEAFOAM-myself.

I was ASHful at first, but it just felt BRIGHT.
Today things are INDIGO-ing MAUVElously:
I ROSE through the ranks,
and now IVORY-ly got the KHAKIs to the kingdom.

So if HUE feel BROWN and out, never give up TAUPE.
Follow your CREAMs and always RUBY yourself.
For the PISTACHIO must go ONYX!

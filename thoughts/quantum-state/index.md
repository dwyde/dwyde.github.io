# Abstract
This paper examines four experiments in which quantum state vectors behave in
surprising ways. Three approaches to modelling the Frauchiger-Renner extended
Wigner's friend setup each can end up with different probabilities for the same
outcomes. An attack on a quantum key exchange appears to involve the zeroing of
one qubit affecting the state of another qubit, which does not make physical
sense. In quantum teleportation, it is difficult to define a state where two
qubits agree in the x and z bases but can have arbitrary probabilities. A
simple circuit features a gate that only has an effect in certain
interpretations of quantum mechanics.

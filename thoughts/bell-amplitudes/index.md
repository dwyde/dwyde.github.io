# Abstract
Bell's theorem adds probabilities when it should use amplitudes. With
amplitudes and trigonometric identities, a theory in which the result at one
detector does not depend on the other detector's setting or outcome can produce
the correct statistics for a Bell test. When a photon's polarization before a
measurement is a hidden variable, Bell's theorem thus does not rule out local
realism.


# Notes
I've previously written about [Bell tests](/thoughts/quantum-bell/) and
[local realism](/thoughts/quantum-local-realism/).

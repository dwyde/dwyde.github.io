Do the laws of physics affect big and small things differently?

*A Deterministic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics*,
<a href="/docs/wyde-quantum.pdf">4 pages</a>.

Quantum mechanics describes particles with wave-like behavior,
entangled particles whose measurements are correlated, and other phenomena that
are hard to explain with ideas developed before 1900.

Different interpretations of quantum mechanics make the same real-world predictions but tell divergent stories about why and how things happen.
Bohm's interpretation handles the wave-particle duality well, but its explanation of entanglement
is incompatible with relativity.

A modified version of Bohm's interpretation can explain entanglement as a past
interaction between two independent particles. This new theory is deterministic and resolves paradoxes such as Schr&ouml;dinger's cat and Wigner's friend.

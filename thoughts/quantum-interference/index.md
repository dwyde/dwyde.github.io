# Abstract
A local realist theory can make the correct predictions for a Bell test, under
a small set of assumptions: that a Bell test involves interference, a photon
can have a linear polarization and certain probability amplitudes before it
reaches a polarizer, and two photons in a Bell pair initially travel in
opposite directions. This paper attempts to justify those claims, and to
explore how and when to account for quantum interference.

# Notes
This paper is a follow-up to a previous one on [Bell's theorem](/thoughts/bell-amplitudes/).

# Abstract
An attacker who intercepts qubits can break certain classes of quantum key
distribution protocols. The idea is to record classical bits for outcomes in
each of the small set of allowed measurement bases, for each qubit sent during
the key exchange, using a sequence of simple quantum circuits. That approach
also seems to enable predicting the future results of non-commuting
measurements, which the uncertainty principle forbids.

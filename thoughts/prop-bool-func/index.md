# Abstract
To negate logical connectives such as implication, or gates such as AND
and OR in computer science, we flip the output entries of the original
function's truth table.  The present paper explores whether a similar
approach to negation can apply to paradoxes such as the liar, the
truth-teller, the card paradox, and Yablo's paradox. The two main
ideas are that the liar and the truth-teller are negations of
each other, and a general approach to determining the truth of
systems of sentences that refer to each other.

# Notes
This paper is a follow-up to my [previous paper](/thoughts/self-reference/) on
self-reference and paradoxes.

# Abstract
A self-referential sentence, when negated or joined with another sentence, should refer to the new sentence (itself) rather than the original one. Thus, the liar and the truth-teller are negations of each other. This paper uses a classical logic based on the above approach to examine the liar, Curry's paradox, and related topics.

# Notes
This paper extends some of my [earlier ideas](/thoughts/moonshot-papers/#negation) on
the liar, the truth-teller, and G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorems.
